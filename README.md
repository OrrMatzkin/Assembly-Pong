# Assembly-Pong

As part of my high school studies in Computer Science I learned Assembly language, a  low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions. For my final project I decided to create my own Pong game.

Pong is a table tennisâ€“themed arcade sports video game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics, manufactured by Atari and originally released in 1972. It was one of the earliest arcade video games; it was created by Allan Alcorn as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, but Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney were surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work and decided to manufacture the game. 

For running my Pong game I used "EMU8086 - MICROPROCESSOR EMULATOR", it provides me the ability to emulate an old 8086 processors, which were used in Macintosh and Windows computers from the 1980s and early 1990s.


For more information about the game see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong.

## Requirements
Pong requires the followin to run:

- EMU8086 - MICROPROCESSOR EMULATOR

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/OrrMatzkin/Assembly-Pong.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Assembly-Pong
```

click pong.exe.

*You might need to install a 8086 processors emulator.
